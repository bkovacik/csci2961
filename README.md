## lab 2

1. done
2. Adding a license to your project adds a guarantee on the freedoms that your program offers. Depending on the restrictiveness of the license and whether the license is even open source or not, the program might offer more or less freedoms. In addition, if you don't add a license to your project, it defaults to the most restrictive license, ie one that offers no freedom to end users.
3. A project that has no licenses makes no guarantees about what it actually requires of the end user. For example, it might require compliance of the terms set forth by a software whose use isn't free. The license is also subject to retroactive changes that the user would have to agree to to continue using the software.
4. I agree that the Gopher project failed because of a lack of support. The open thinking did not apply to Gopher because it required some groups to pay for the service. While it was arguably a better service, it did not receive as much support as it needed because it was not an open system, which ultimately led to its failure.
5. The Sailfish OS most likely chose a non-Open Source license because it intends to create a meritocracy of developers such that not every developer can develop for the platform; only the ones that are good and serious.
6. Apache

9. I'd like to learn about the GLASS stack. We'd probably use the Apache license, as that is the license we chose for step 6.

10. I started living off-campus this semester and I realized that a sort of "better grocery list" could be a worthwhile project. My roommate and I share the bill for necessities like food, but we both have a tendency to buy things that the other person might not want or need. Among other things, this improved grocery list could be used to write down which are actual necessities and which are luxuries that the individual roommate would pay for. Other features could be importing recipes into the list, priorities (is truffle butter *really* necessary). It would also contain rough estimates of pricing so a rough estimate of the grocery bill would be available. These prices could be inputted manually or in later versions, obtained via crowdsourcing or some other method.
