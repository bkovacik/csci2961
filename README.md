10. I started living off-campus this semester and I realized that a sort of "better grocery list" could be a worthwhile project. My roommate and I share the bill for necessities like food, but we both have a tendency to buy things that the other person might not want or need. Among other things, this improved grocery list could be used to write down which are actual necessities and which are luxuries that the individual roommate would pay for. Other features could be importing recipes into the list, priorities (is truffle butter *really* necessary). It would also contain rough estimates of pricing so a rough estimate of the grocery bill would be available. These prices could be inputted manually or in later versions, obtained via crowdsourcing or some other method.
